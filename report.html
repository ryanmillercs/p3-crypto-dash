    <li>Link to the deployed app: <a href="https://w3stu.cs.jmu.edu/mille3rt/343s23/p3-crypto-dash/">Link</a></li>
    <li>Also available on Github Pages: <a href="https://ryanmillercs.github.io/p3-crypto-dash/">Link</a></li>
    <li>The app I developed is a Crypto Dashboard. The two APIs I used were the <a
        href="https://docs.coincap.io/">Coincap API</a> and the <a href="https://currentsapi.services/en">Currents
        API</a>. These two APIs have great documentation and made it easy for me to find the information I needed.</li>
    <li>Currently my app displays the top 10 Cryptocurrencies reported by the Coincap API. The displayed information
      includes the symbol, rank, price, and supply. The name on the top of the Coin is a button that you can click. Upon
      clicking, the app will make a call to the Currents API to retrieve current news articles about that coin. In
      addition you can search for more coins that are not displayed within the top 10. After searching a list of all the
      coins retrieved by the Coincap API will populate. You can either search again with another coin or click on the
      name of the coin to find out information about them. </li>
    <li>After the news section populates, there is a filter functionality as well. A drop down menu pops up and you can
      limit the articles by day, week, month or search for keywords in the text if you select the custom option.</li>
    <li>The app is deployed on GitHub and W3Stu at the links provided above.</li>
    <li>The app as varying presentation on Mobile and Desktop. On mobile the Coins displayed initially changes to 2
      coins per row. Also the search bar folds away in a hamburger menu. In addition the other functionalities are made
      more mobile friendly. The list of all Cryptocurrencies is much smaller on the top after searching so that it does
      not take up a lot of screen space.</li>
    <li>The project uses two APIs which are linked earlier. The Coincap API and the Currents API</li>
    <li>The App has search functionality, the user can search for a Coin of their choosing. After searching for a coin,
      they can click on the button provided and consume news articles related.</li>
    <li>The news article results are filterable. After clicking on a coin's button you can then choose a drop down menu
      and filter by time: day, week, month, or custom. Custom is a key word filter that will limit results by the
      provided keywords.</li>
